Q2A Sort Answers  
=============================

Description
-----------
This is a plugin for **Question2Answer** that has the capability to to sort answers for current page . 

Limitation 
-----------
As of now I will keep the plugin very simple and straight forward that sorts the answers of the current page only. If the answers is paginated it wont retrive the answers from the other pages to sort and display . 

Disclaimer
----------
It is probably okay for production environments, but may not work exactly as expected.  Refunds will not be given.  If it breaks, you get to keep both parts.
